# GIVE Transaction Logging Microservice


The Transaction Logging Service is a component of GIVE that provides logging
for Verification Events.

## Why this project
The GIVE Transaction Logging microservice aims to provide an audit trail for
transactions that occur within the GIVE system. By allowing other GIVE
microservices to log their transaction records to a centralized service, GIVE
can track anonymized records and usage across the system. The Transaction
Logging microservice has the following goals:
* Provide auditing capabilites for the GIVE system
* Expose usage and reporting data

## Building Locally

### Pre-requisites
Make sure you have the following installed if you intend to build the
project locally.
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/)
- [CloudFoundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/)

### Development setup
To set up your environment, run the following commands (or the equivalent
commands if not using a bash-like terminal):
```shell
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/18F/identity-give-transaction-logging
cd identity-give-transaction-logging
# Set up Python virtual environment
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 on Windows
# Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

:warning: **If you are not able to install `psycopg2`**, please make sure you
have `libpq-dev` installed on your system. For apt, use the following
`sudo apt install -y libpq-dev`

### Required environment variables
The Django settings.py file for this project requires setting an environment
variable: `SECRET_KEY`

Running the following in your shell should print a secret key that can be used.
```shell
python
import secrets
secrets.token_urlsafe()
exit()

```

Set the environment variable using *the entire output* (including quotes) from
the printed secret
```shell
# BASH-like shells
export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-here>
```
```powershell
# PowerShell
Env:SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-here>
```
Note: during development, it may also be helpful to add the `DEBUG` environment
variable and setting it to the string `True`

### Running the application
After completing [development setup](#development-setup) and
[environment variable setup](#required-environment-variables) you can run the
application with:

```shell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8080 transaction_log.wsgi
```

A windows alternative for gunicorn is `waitress`:

``` shell
pip install waitress

waitress-serve --port=8080 transaction_log.wsgi:application
```

### Deploying to Cloud.gov during development
All deployments require having the correct Cloud.gov credentials in place. If
you haven't already, visit [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) and set up your
account and CLI.

*manifest.yml* file contains the deployment configuration for cloud.gov, and
expects a vars.yaml file that includes runtime variables referenced. For info,
see [cloud foundry manifest files reference](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html)

The application database must be deployed prior to the application, and can be
deployed with the following commands:
```shell
cf create-service aws-rds <plan> transaction-log-db
```

*You must wait* until the database has completed provisioning to continue with
the deployment. Wait for the `status` field of `cf service transaction-log-db`
to change from `create in progress` to `create succeeded`.
```shell
watch -n 15 cf service transaction-log-db
```

After the database has come up, running
`cf push --vars-file vars.yaml --var SECRET_KEY=$SECRET_KEY`.

### Available Endpoints

`/transaction`
